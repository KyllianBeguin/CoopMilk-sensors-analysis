*The purpose of this repo is to show how data can be used in a specific use case. It can be seen as a sandbox project, to play with some techs.*

## Data for analyzing milk quality !
This project is about using data about various parameters to assess the quality of a milk company called COOP'MILK ! At first, it was supposed to be a small project for our class, back in 2021, and now we use to show people how it's cool to work with data ðŸ˜Ž!  

**Disclaimer**: it wont reflect the reality of a company that uses data to do such things. But, the infrastructure used in this project is the best compromise between the laziness of deploying something, and showing real world!  

## Wanna play with this project ?!
So you're hypped and want to deploy this little baby to have some fancy night watching at your real time graphics ?  
Before having fun, here are some requirements you should follow :

- [ ] Grab a cup of coffee, a nice sweet blanket, your favorite hoodie !
